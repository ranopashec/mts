# iOS Security Architecture

## Platform-Specific Threats  

1. **Jailbroken Devices** – Increased risk of bypassing security measures.  
2. **App Store Side-Loading** – Users installing modified or malicious versions.  
3. **Weak Keychain Protection** – Improper storage of sensitive data.  

## Security Measures  

### **Authentication & Authorization**  
- Use [Face ID & Touch ID Authentication](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/localauthentication).  
- Implement [Sign in with Apple](https://developer.apple.com/sign-in-with-apple/) for secure login.  

### **Data Protection**  
- Utilize [Secure Enclaves](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/secure_enclave) for cryptographic operations.  
- Store sensitive data in the [iOS Keychain](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/keychain_services).  
- Enable file encryption via [Data Protection API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/fileprotectiontype).  

### **App Hardening & Integrity**  
- Strip bitcode to prevent reverse engineering.  
- Enforce HTTPS connections with [App Transport Security (ATS)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/app_transport_security).  
- Detect jailbreak status using private APIs.  

### **Network Security**  
- Use [NSURLSession](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsurlsession) for secure network requests.  
- Implement certificate pinning in [URLSession](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/secure_transport).  

### **CI/CD & Deployment Security**  
- Require [Apple Notarization](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/notarizing_your_app_before_distribution) for app distribution.  
- Monitor dependencies with [Swift Package Manager Audit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift_packages).
